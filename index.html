            <img src="/assets/images/thumbnail.jpg" alt="Saul Harwin" class="thumbnail"/>
            <p id="about-me">I’m a recent Physics graduate (2:1 BSc) with a solid foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving, and a growing passion for software engineering. Throughout university, I developed my technical and programming skills through a mix of coursework and self-directed projects, from writing simulations to experimenting with different tools and technologies. Now, I’m excited to bring that knowledge into a real-world development environment. Studying Physics taught me how to tackle complex problems in a logical, structured way and to think critically under pressure. These are skills that translate well into writing clean, efficient, and reliable code. Beyond academics, I also volunteer at a local sailing club, where I teach children and help coordinate group activities. This experience has really helped me build strong communication, leadership, and teamwork skills. These are qualities I bring to any collaborative setting. I’m actively looking for junior software engineering opportunities where I can continue learning from experienced developers, contribute to meaningful projects, and grow my career at the intersection of science and technology. If you’re working on something exciting in that space, I’d love to connect.</p>

                        I am currently investigating whether I can link map configurations to the gameplay of the board game Settlers of Catan. My goal is to train an AI agent to play the game against itself many times, then to analyse the data collected using machine learning methods to link parameters to gameplay. This, if successful, will lead to a map generator which depends on different slider parameters such as aggressiveness, fairness, etc.

                    <p>
                        In this project, I built a flocking bird simulation to explore how complex group behaviour can emerge from very simple rules. By modelling each bird’s local interactions, I found it interesting to see how realistic flocking patterns naturally formed, which gave me a much more intuitive understanding of emergent behaviour and agent-based modelling.

                        I began a final-year research project at the University of Sussex focused on weak gravitational lensing, where I analysed simulated galaxy cluster data to extract and model the subtle distortions (shear) induced by foreground mass distributions using the Singular Isothermal Sphere (SIS) model. The work involved processing shape measurements from a large sample of background galaxies, building a statistical fitting pipeline, estimating astrophysical parameters like Einstein radius and mass, and assessing how intrinsic noise influences parameter accuracy.

It made the connection between theory and real-world problem solving feel much more concrete.
