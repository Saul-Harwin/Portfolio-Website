        <p>This is my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my projects, skills, and experience in a clean, professional format. The site is designed with simplicity and responsiveness in mind, making it easy for employers and collaborators to quickly learn about my work.</p>

        <h3>Goals and Motivations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide a central hub for my projects, resume, and contact information.</li>
          <li>Create a professional online presence that reflects my style and skills.</li>
          <li>Prioritize performance, responsive design, and accessibility.</li>
          <li>Gain hands-on experience in deploying and maintaining a live website.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>NodeJS Server using pm2</li>
          <li>Responsive website that adapts seamlessly to mobile, tablet and desktop</li>
          <li>Project Cards with hover effects and a horizontal scrolling flex container containing tag</li>
          <li>Minimal design system with consistent typography and spacing.</li>
          <li>Contact form that uses EmailJS to send and email with forms content to me.</li>
          <li>Easily accessible links to both my LinkedIn and Github profile with Github link for each of the projects.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Deployment Setup</h3>
        <p>I built my portfolio website using pure HTML and CSS for the front end. To serve the site, I set up a lightweight Node.js server, which handles delivering the static files to visitors. I manage the Node process with PM2, which ensures the server stays online, restarts automatically if it crashes, and runs in the background after reboots.</p>
        <p>The application is deployed on a DigitalOcean droplet, where PM2 keeps the Node server running continuously. This setup gives me full control over the hosting environment while keeping the deployment simple and reliable.</p>
        <p>To streamline updates, I configured a cron job to run every 30 minutes. This job pulls the latest code from the main branch on GitHub. With PM2’s file-watching enabled on the server directory, the application automatically reloads whenever new changes are detected.</p>

        <h4>Advantages to my Setup</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Continuous deployment with minimal manual intervention</li>
          <li>Automatic recovery and uptime monitoring via PM2</li>
          <li>A lightweight, cost-effective hosting solution on DigitalOcean</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Home Page</h3>
        <p>The Home page serves as the entry point to the portfolio website. It introduces visitors to who I am, highlights my skills at a glance, and provides quick access to the main sections of the site. A clean navigation bar allows users to explore projects, my CV, and contact information.</p>
        <p>The About section provides a brief overview of my background, interests, and goals as a developer. It is kept concise, highlighting my academic and professional journey and the skills I have gained, along with a headshot, so the readers quickly understand who I am.</p>
